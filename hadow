DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       DDiiaalloogg  is a program that will let you present a variety of questions or display messages using dialog boxes from a shell script.  These types
       of dialog boxes are implemented (though not all are necessarily compiled into ddiiaalloogg):

              bbuuiillddlliisstt, ccaalleennddaarr, cchheecckklliisstt, ddsseelleecctt, eeddiittbbooxx, ffoorrmm, ffsseelleecctt, ggaauuggee, iinnffoobbooxx, iinnppuuttbbooxx, iinnppuuttmmeennuu, mmeennuu, mmiixxeeddffoorrmm, mmiixxeeddggaauuggee,
              mmssggbbooxx (message), ppaasssswwoorrddbbooxx, ppaasssswwoorrddffoorrmm, ppaauussee, pprrggbbooxx, pprrooggrraammbbooxx, pprrooggrreessssbbooxx, rraaddiioolliisstt, rraannggeebbooxx, ttaaiillbbooxx, ttaaiillbbooxxbbgg, tteexxttbbooxx,
              ttiimmeebbooxx, ttrreeeevviieeww, and yyeessnnoo (yes/no).

       You can put more than one dialog box into a script:

       +o   Use the "----aanndd--wwiiddggeett" token to force ddiiaalloogg to proceed to the next dialog unless you have pressed ESC to cancel, or

       +o   Simply add the tokens for the next dialog box, making a chain.  Dialog stops chaining when the return code from a dialog is nonzero, e.g.,
           Cancel or No (see DIAGNOSTICS).

       Some  widgets,  e.g.,  checklist, will write text to ddiiaalloogg's output.  Normally that is the standard error, but there are options for changing
       this: "----oouuttppuutt--ffdd", "----ssttddeerrrr" and "----ssttddoouutt".  No text is written if the Cancel button (or ESC) is pressed; ddiiaalloogg exits immediately in that
       case.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       All options begin with "----" (two ASCII hyphens, for the benefit of those using systems with deranged locale support).

       A "----" by itself is used as an escape, i.e., the next token on the command-line is not treated as an option.
              ddiiaalloogg ----ttiittllee ---- ----NNoott aann ooppttiioonn

       The "----aarrggss" option tells ddiiaalloogg to list the command-line parameters to the standard error.  This is useful when debugging complex scripts us-
       ing the "----" and "----ffiillee", since the command-line may be rewritten as these are expanded.

       The "----ffiillee" option tells ddiiaalloogg to read parameters from the file named as its value.
              ddiiaalloogg ----ffiillee _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_f_i_l_e

       Blanks not within double-quotes are discarded (use backslashes to quote single characters).  The result is inserted into the command-line, re-
       placing  "----ffiillee" and its option value.  Interpretation of the command-line resumes from that point.  If _p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_f_i_l_e begins with "&", ddiiaalloogg
       interprets the following text as a file descriptor number rather than a filename.

       Most widgets accept _h_e_i_g_h_t and _w_i_d_t_h parameters, which can be used to automatically size the widget to accommodate multi-line  message  _p_r_o_m_p_t
       values:

       +o   If the parameter is negative, ddiiaalloogg uses the screen's size.

       +o   If the parameter is zero, ddiiaalloogg uses minimum size for the widget to display the _p_r_o_m_p_t and data.

       +o   Otherwise, ddiiaalloogg uses the given size for the widget.

   CCoommmmoonn OOppttiioonnss
       Most of the common options are reset before processing each widget.

       ----aasscciiii--lliinneess
              Rather than draw graphics lines around boxes, draw ASCII "+" and "-" in the same place.  See also "----nnoo--lliinneess".

       ----aassppeecctt _r_a_t_i_o
              This  gives you some control over the box dimensions when using auto sizing (specifying 0 for height and width).  It represents width /
              height.  The default is 9, which means 9 characters wide to every 1 line high.

       ----bbaacckkttiittllee _b_a_c_k_t_i_t_l_e
              Specifies a _b_a_c_k_t_i_t_l_e string to be displayed on the backdrop, at the top of the screen.

       ----bbeeggiinn _y _x
              Specify the position of the upper left corner of a dialog box on the screen.

       ----ccaanncceell--llaabbeell _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Override the label used for "Cancel" buttons.

       ----cclleeaarr
              Clears the widget screen, keeping only the screen_color background.  Use this when you combine widgets with "----aanndd--wwiiddggeett" to erase the
              contents of a previous widget on the screen, so it won't be seen under the contents of a following widget.  Understand this as the com-
              plement of "----kkeeeepp--wwiinnddooww".  To compare the effects, use these:

              All three widgets visible, staircase effect, ordered 1,2,3:

              dialog \
                                             --begin 2 2 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget               --begin 4 4 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget               --begin 6 6 --yesno "" 0 0

              Only the last widget is left visible:

              dialog \
                               --clear       --begin 2 2 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget --clear       --begin 4 4 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget               --begin 6 6 --yesno "" 0 0

              All three widgets visible, staircase effect, ordered 3,2,1:

              dialog \
                               --keep-window --begin 2 2 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget --keep-window --begin 4 4 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget               --begin 6 6 --yesno "" 0 0

              First and third widget visible, staircase effect, ordered 3,1:

              dialog \
                               --keep-window --begin 2 2 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget --clear       --begin 4 4 --yesno "" 0 0 \
                  --and-widget               --begin 6 6 --yesno "" 0 0

              Note, if you want to restore original console colors and send your cursor home after the dialog program has exited, use  the  cclleeaarr (1)
              command.

       ----ccoolloorrss
              Interpret embedded "\Z" sequences in the dialog text by the following character, which tells ddiiaalloogg to set colors or video attributes:

              +o   0 through 7 are the ANSI color numbers used in curses: black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white respectively.

              +o   Bold is set by 'b', reset by 'B'.

              +o   Reverse is set by 'r', reset by 'R'.

              +o   Underline is set by 'u', reset by 'U'.

              +o   The settings are cumulative, e.g., "\Zb\Z1" makes the following text bold (perhaps bright) red.

              +o   Restore normal settings with "\Zn".

       ----ccoolluummnn--sseeppaarraattoorr _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Tell  ddiiaalloogg to split data for radio/checkboxes and menus on the occurrences of the given string, and to align the split data into col-
              umns.

       ----ccrr--wwrraapp
              Interpret embedded newlines in the dialog text as a newline on the screen.  Otherwise, ddiiaalloogg will only wrap lines where needed to  fit
              inside the text box.

              Even  though you can control line breaks with this, DDiiaalloogg will still wrap any lines that are too long for the width of the box.  With-
              out cr-wrap, the layout of your text may be formatted to look nice in the source code of your script without affecting the way it  will
              look in the dialog.

              The _c_r_-_w_r_a_p feature is implemented subject to these conditions:

              +o   the string contains "\n" and the ----nnoo--nnll--eexxppaanndd option is not used, or

              +o   the ----ttrriimm option is used.

              For more information, see WWhhiitteessppaaccee OOppttiioonnss.

       ----ccrreeaattee--rrcc _f_i_l_e
              When ddiiaalloogg supports run-time configuration, this can be used to dump a sample configuration file to the file specified by _f_i_l_e.

       ----ddaattee--ffoorrmmaatt _f_o_r_m_a_t
              If the host provides ssttrrffttiimmee, this option allows you to specify the format of the date printed for the ----ccaalleennddaarr widget.  The time of
              day (hour, minute, second) are the current local time.

       ----ddeeffaauullttnnoo
              Make the default value of the yyeess//nnoo box a NNoo.  Likewise, treat the default button of widgets that provide "OK" and "Cancel" as a  _C_a_n_-
              _c_e_l.  If "----nnooccaanncceell" or "----vviissiitt--iitteemmss" are given those options overrides this, making the default button always "Yes" (internally the
              same as "OK").

       ----ddeeffaauulltt--bbuuttttoonn _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Set the default (preselected) button in a widget.  By preselecting a button, a script makes it possible for the user  to  simply  press
              _E_n_t_e_r to proceed through a dialog with minimum interaction.

              The option's value is the name of the button: _o_k, _y_e_s, _c_a_n_c_e_l, _n_o, _h_e_l_p or _e_x_t_r_a.

              Normally the first button in each widget is the default.  The first button shown is determined by the widget together with the "----nnooookk"
              and "----nnooccaanncceell options.  If this option is not given, there is no default button assigned.

       ----ddeeffaauulltt--iitteemm _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Set the default item in a checklist, form or menu box.  Normally the first item in the box is the default.

       ----eexxiitt--llaabbeell _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Override the label used for "EXIT" buttons.

       ----eexxttrraa--bbuuttttoonn
              Show an extra button, between "OK" and "Cancel" buttons.

       ----eexxttrraa--llaabbeell _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Override the label used for "Extra" buttons.  Note: for inputmenu widgets, this defaults to "Rename".

       ----hheellpp Prints the help message to the standard output and exits.  The help message is also printed if no options are given, or if an  unrecog-
              nized option is given.

       ----hheellpp--bbuuttttoonn
              Show  a help-button after "OK" and "Cancel" buttons, e.g., in checklist, radiolist and menu boxes, and other widgets which have an "OK"
              button, whether or not the "Cancel" button is used.

              On exit, the return status will indicate that the Help button was pressed.  DDiiaalloogg will also write a message to its  output  after  the
              token "HELP":

              +o   If "----iitteemm--hheellpp" is also given, the item-help text will be written.

              +o   Otherwise, the item's tag (the first field) will be written.

              You can use the ----hheellpp--ttaaggss option and/or set the DIALOG_ITEM_HELP environment variable to modify these messages and exit-status.

       ----hheellpp--llaabbeell _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Override the label used for "Help" buttons.

       ----hheellpp--ssttaattuuss
              If  the  help-button is selected, writes the checklist, radiolist or form information after the item-help "HELP" information.  This can
              be used to reconstruct the state of a checklist after processing the help request.

       ----hheellpp--ttaaggss
              Modify the messages written on exit for ----hheellpp--bbuuttttoonn by making them always just the item's tag.  This does not affect the exit  status
              code.

       ----hhffiillee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Display the given file using a textbox when the user presses F1.

       ----hhlliinnee _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Display the given string centered at the bottom of the widget.

       ----iiggnnoorree
              Ignore  options  that ddiiaalloogg does not recognize.  Some well-known ones such as "----iiccoonn" are ignored anyway, but this is a better choice
              for compatibility with other implementations.

       ----iinnppuutt--ffdd _f_d
              Read keyboard input from the given file descriptor.  Most ddiiaalloogg scripts read from the standard input, but the  gauge  widget  reads  a
              pipe  (which  is  always standard input).  Some configurations do not work properly when ddiiaalloogg tries to reopen the terminal.  Use this
              option (with appropriate juggling of file-descriptors) if your script must work in that type of environment.

       ----iinnsseeccuurree
              Makes the password widget friendlier but less secure, by echoing asterisks for each character.

       ----iissoo--wweeeekk
              Set the starting point for the week-number shown in the "----ccaalleennddaarr" option according to ISO-8601,  which  starts  numbering  with  the
              first week which includes a Thursday in January.

       ----iitteemm--hheellpp
              Interpret  the  tags  data for checklist, radiolist and menu boxes adding a column which is displayed in the bottom line of the screen,
              for the currently selected item.

       ----kkeeeepp--ttiittee
              When built with nnccuurrsseess, ddiiaalloogg normally checks to see if it is running in an xxtteerrmm, and in that case tries to suppress the initializa-
              tion  strings  that  would make it switch to the alternate screen.  Switching between the normal and alternate screens is visually dis-
              tracting in a script which runs ddiiaalloogg several times.  Use this option to allow ddiiaalloogg to use those initialization strings.

       ----kkeeeepp--wwiinnddooww
              Normally when ddiiaalloogg performs several ttaaiillbbooxxbbgg widgets connected by "----aanndd--wwiiddggeett", it clears the old widget from the screen by paint-
              ing over it.  Use this option to suppress that repainting.

              At  exit, ddiiaalloogg repaints all of the widgets which have been marked with "----kkeeeepp--wwiinnddooww", even if they are not ttaaiillbbooxxbbgg widgets.  That
              causes them to be repainted in reverse order.  See the discussion of the "----cclleeaarr" option for examples.

       ----llaasstt--kkeeyy
              At exit, report the last key which the user entered.  This is the curses key code rather than a symbol or literal character.  It can be
              used by scripts to distinguish between two keys which are bound to the same action.

       ----mmaaxx--iinnppuutt _s_i_z_e
              Limit input strings to the given size.  If not specified, the limit is 2048.

       ----nnoo--ccaanncceell

       ----nnooccaanncceell
              Suppress  the  "Cancel"  button  in checklist, inputbox and menu box modes.  A script can still test if the user pressed the ESC key to
              cancel to quit.

       ----nnoo--ccoollllaappssee
              Normally ddiiaalloogg converts tabs to spaces and reduces multiple spaces to a single space for text which is displayed in a  message  boxes,
              etc.  Use this option to disable that feature.  Note that ddiiaalloogg will still wrap text, subject to the "----ccrr--wwrraapp" and "----ttrriimm" options.

              The _n_o_-_c_o_l_l_a_p_s_e feature is implemented subject to these conditions:

              +o   the string contains "\n" and the ----nnoo--nnll--eexxppaanndd option is not used, or

              +o   the ----ttrriimm option is not used.

              For more information, see WWhhiitteessppaaccee OOppttiioonnss.

       ----nnoo--iitteemmss
              Some  widgets  (checklist, inputmenu, radiolist, menu) display a list with two columns (a "tag" and "item", i.e., "description").  This
              option tells ddiiaalloogg to read shorter rows, omitting the "item" part of the list.  This is occasionally useful, e.g., if the tags provide
              enough information.

              See also ----nnoo--ttaaggss.  If both options are given, this one is ignored.

       ----nnoo--kkiillll
              Tells  ddiiaalloogg to put the ttaaiillbbooxxbbgg box in the background, printing its process id to ddiiaalloogg's output.  SIGHUP is disabled for the back-
              ground process.

       ----nnoo--llaabbeell _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Override the label used for "No" buttons.

       ----nnoo--lliinneess
              Rather than draw lines around boxes, draw spaces in the same place.  See also "----aasscciiii--lliinneess".

       ----nnoo--mmoouussee
              Do not enable the mouse.

       ----nnoo--nnll--eexxppaanndd
              Do not convert "\n" substrings of the message/prompt text into literal newlines.

              The _n_o_-_n_l_-_e_x_p_a_n_d feature is used only if the string contains "\n" so that there is something to convert.

              For more information, see WWhhiitteessppaaccee OOppttiioonnss.

       ----nnoo--ookk

       ----nnooookk Suppress the "OK" button in checklist, inputbox and menu box modes.  A script can still test if the user pressed the "Enter" key to ac-
              cept the data.

       ----nnoo--sshhaaddooww
              Suppress shadows that would be drawn to the right and bottom of each dialog box.

       ----nnoo--ttaaggss
              Some  widgets  (checklist,  inputmenu, radiolist, menu) display a list with two columns (a "tag" and "description").  The tag is useful
              for scripting, but may not help the user.  The ----nnoo--ttaaggss option (from Xdialog) may be used to suppress the column of tags from the dis-
              play.  Unlike the ----nnoo--iitteemmss option, this does not affect the data which is read from the script.

              Xdialog does not display the tag column for the analogous buildlist and treeview widgets; ddiiaalloogg does the same.

              Normally  ddiiaalloogg  allows you to quickly move to entries on the displayed list, by matching a single character to the first character of
              the tag.  When the ----nnoo--ttaaggss option is given, ddiiaalloogg matches against the first character of  the  description.   In  either  case,  the
              matchable character is highlighted.

       ----ookk--llaabbeell _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Override the label used for "OK" buttons.

       ----oouuttppuutt--ffdd _f_d
              Direct  output  to  the given file descriptor.  Most ddiiaalloogg scripts write to the standard error, but error messages may also be written
              there, depending on your script.

       ----sseeppaarraattoorr _s_t_r_i_n_g

       ----oouuttppuutt--sseeppaarraattoorr _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Specify a string that will separate the output on ddiiaalloogg's output from checklists, rather than a newline (for ----sseeppaarraattee--oouuttppuutt)  or  a
              space.  This applies to other widgets such as forms and editboxes which normally use a newline.

       ----pprriinntt--mmaaxxssiizzee
              Print the maximum size of dialog boxes, i.e., the screen size, to ddiiaalloogg's output.  This may be used alone, without other options.

       ----pprriinntt--ssiizzee
              Prints the size of each dialog box to ddiiaalloogg's output when the box is initialized.

       ----pprriinntt--tteexxtt--oonnllyy _s_t_r_i_n_g _[ _h_e_i_g_h_t _[ _w_i_d_t_h _] _]
              Prints the string as it would be wrapped in a message box to ddiiaalloogg's output.

              Because the optional _h_e_i_g_h_t and _w_i_d_t_h default to zero, if they are omitted, ddiiaalloogg autosizes according to the screen dimensions.

       ----pprriinntt--tteexxtt--ssiizzee _s_t_r_i_n_g _[ _h_e_i_g_h_t _[ _w_i_d_t_h _] _]
              Prints the size of the string as it would be wrapped in a message box, to ddiiaalloogg's output, as

              height width

              Because  the optional _h_e_i_g_h_t and _w_i_d_t_h parameters default to zero, if they are omitted, ddiiaalloogg autosizes according to the screen dimen-
              sions.

       ----pprriinntt--vveerrssiioonn
              Prints ddiiaalloogg's version to ddiiaalloogg's output.  This may be used alone, without other options.  It does not cause ddiiaalloogg to  exit  by  it-
              self.

       ----qquuootteedd
              Normally ddiiaalloogg quotes the strings returned by checklist's as well as the item-help text.  Use this option to quote all string results.

       ----rreeoorrddeerr
              By default, the buildlist widget uses the same order for the output (right) list as for the input (left).  Use this option to tell ddiiaa--
              lloogg to use the order in which a user adds selections to the output list.

       ----ssccrroollllbbaarr
              For widgets holding a scrollable set of data, draw a scrollbar on its right-margin.  This does not respond to the mouse.

       ----sseeppaarraattee--oouuttppuutt
              For certain widgets (buildlist, checklist, treeview), output result one line at a time, with no quoting.  This facilitates  parsing  by
              another program.

       ----sseeppaarraattee--wwiiddggeett _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Specify  a  string that will separate the output on ddiiaalloogg's output from each widget.  This is used to simplify parsing the result of a
              dialog with several widgets.  If this option is not given, the default separator string is a tab character.

       ----sshhaaddooww
              Draw a shadow to the right and bottom of each dialog box.

       ----ssiinnggllee--qquuootteedd
              Use single-quoting as needed (and no quotes if unneeded) for the output of checklist's as well as the item-help text.  If  this  option
              is  not  set,  ddiiaalloogg  uses double quotes around each item.  In either case, ddiiaalloogg adds backslashes to make the output useful in shell
              scripts.

       ----ssiizzee--eerrrr
              Check the resulting size of a dialog box before trying to use it, printing the resulting size if it is larger than the  screen.   (This
              option is obsolete, since all new-window calls are checked).

       ----sslleeeepp _s_e_c_s
              Sleep (delay) for the given number of seconds after processing a dialog box.

       ----ssttddeerrrr
              Direct output to the standard error.  This is the default, since curses normally writes screen updates to the standard output.

       ----ssttddoouutt
              Direct  output to the standard output.  This option is provided for compatibility with Xdialog, however using it in portable scripts is
              not recommended, since curses normally writes its screen updates to the standard output.  If you use this option,  ddiiaalloogg  attempts  to
              reopen the terminal so it can write to the display.  Depending on the platform and your environment, that may fail.

       ----ttaabb--ccoorrrreecctt
              Convert  each  tab character to one or more spaces (for the tteexxttbbooxx widget; otherwise to a single space).  Otherwise, tabs are rendered
              according to the curses library's interpretation.  The ----nnoo--ccoollllaappssee option disables tab expansion.

       ----ttaabb--lleenn _n
              Specify the number of spaces that a tab character occupies if the "----ttaabb--ccoorrrreecctt" option is given.  The default is 8.  This  option  is
              only effective for the tteexxttbbooxx widget.

       ----ttiimmee--ffoorrmmaatt _f_o_r_m_a_t
              If  the  host  provides  ssttrrffttiimmee, this option allows you to specify the format of the time printed for the ----ttiimmeebbooxx widget.  The day,
              month, year values in this case are for the current local time.

       ----ttiimmeeoouutt _s_e_c_s
              Timeout (exit with error code) if no user response within the given number of seconds.  A timeout of zero seconds is ignored.

              This option is ignored by the "----ppaauussee" widget.  It is also overridden if the background "----ttaaiillbbooxxbbgg" option is used to set up  multi-
              ple concurrent widgets.

       ----ttiittllee _t_i_t_l_e
              Specifies a _t_i_t_l_e string to be displayed at the top of the dialog box.

       ----ttrraaccee _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              logs  the  command-line parameters, keystrokes and other information to the given file.  If ddiiaalloogg reads a configure file, it is logged
              as well.  Piped input to the _g_a_u_g_e widget is logged.  Use control/T to log a picture of the current dialog window.

              The ddiiaalloogg program handles some command-line parameters specially, and removes them from the parameter list as they are processed.  For
              example, if the first option is ----ttrraaccee, then that is processed (and removed) before ddiiaalloogg initializes the display.

       ----wweeeekk--ssttaarrtt _d_a_y
              sets the starting day for the week, used in the "----ccaalleennddaarr" option.  The _d_a_y parameter can be

              +o   a number (0 to 6, Sunday through Saturday using POSIX) or

              +o   the  special  value  "locale" (this works with systems using glibc, providing an extension to the llooccaallee command, the ffiirrsstt__wweeeekkddaayy
                  value).

              +o   a string matching one of the abbreviations for the day of the week shown in the ccaalleennddaarr widget, e.g., "Mo" for "Monday".

       ----ttrriimm eliminate leading blanks, trim literal newlines and repeated blanks from message text.

              The _t_r_i_m feature is implemented subject to these conditions:

              +o   the string does not contain "\n" or

              +o   the ----nnoo--nnll--eexxppaanndd option is used.

              For more information, see WWhhiitteessppaaccee OOppttiioonnss.

              See also the "----ccrr--wwrraapp" and "----nnoo--ccoollllaappssee" options.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Prints ddiiaalloogg's version to the standard output, and exits.  See also "----pprriinntt--vveerrssiioonn".

       ----vviissiitt--iitteemmss
              Modify the tab-traversal of checklist, radiolist, menubox and inputmenu to include the list of items as one of  the  states.   This  is
              useful as a visual aid, i.e., the cursor position helps some users.

              When  this  option is given, the cursor is initially placed on the list.  Abbreviations (the first letter of the tag) apply to the list
              items.  If you tab to the button row, abbreviations apply to the buttons.

       ----yyeess--llaabbeell _s_t_r_i_n_g
              Override the label used for "Yes" buttons.

   BBooxx OOppttiioonnss
       All dialog boxes have at least three parameters:

       _t_e_x_t   the caption or contents of the box.

       _h_e_i_g_h_t the height of the dialog box.

       _w_i_d_t_h  the width of the dialog box.

       Other parameters depend on the box type.

       ----bbuuiillddlliisstt _t_e_x_t _h_e_i_g_h_t _w_i_d_t_h _l_i_s_t_-_h_e_i_g_h_t [ _t_a_g _i_t_e_m _s_t_a_t_u_s ] _._._.
              A bbuuiillddlliisstt dialog displays two lists, side-by-side.  The list on the left shows unselected items.  The list on the right shows select-
              ed items.  As items are selected or unselected, they move between the lists.

              Use  a  carriage  return or the "OK" button to accept the current value in the selected-window and exit.  The results are written using
              the order displayed in the selected-window.

              The initial on/off state of each entry is specified by _s_t_a_t_u_s.

              The dialog behaves like a mmeennuu, using the ----vviissiitt--iitteemmss to control whether the cursor is allowed to visit the lists directly.

              +o   If ----vviissiitt--iitteemmss is not given, tab-traversal uses two states (OK/Cancel).

              +o   If ----vviissiitt--iitteemmss is given, tab-traversal uses four states (Left/Right/OK/Cancel).

              Whether or not ----vviissiitt--iitteemmss is given, it is possible to move the highlight between the two lists using the default  "^"  (left-column)
              and "$" (right-column) keys.

              On exit, a list of the _t_a_g strings of those entries that are turned on will be printed on ddiiaalloogg's output.

              If  the  "----sseeppaarraattee--oouuttppuutt"  option is not given, the strings will be quoted as needed to make it simple for scripts to separate them.
              By default, this uses double-quotes.  See the "----ssiinnggllee--qquuootteedd" option, which modifies the quoting behavior.

       ----ccaalleennddaarr _t_e_x_t _h_e_i_g_h_t _w_i_d_t_h _d_a_y _m_o_n_t_h _y_e_a_r
              A ccaalleennddaarr box displays month, day and year in separately adjustable windows.  If the values for day, month or year are missing or neg-
              ative, the current date's corresponding values are used.  You can increment or decrement any of those using the left-, up-, right-, and
              down-arrows.  Use vi-style h, j, k and l for moving around the array of days in a month.  Use tab or backtab to move  between  windows.
              If the year is given as zero, the current date is used as an initial value.

              On exit, the date is printed in the form day/month/year.  The format can be overridden using the ----ddaattee--ffoorrmmaatt option.

       ----cchheecckklliisstt _t_e_x_t _h_e_i_g_h_t _w_i_d_t_h _l_i_s_t_-_h_e_i_g_h_t [ _t_a_g _i_t_e_m _s_t_a_t_u_s ] _._._.
              A  cchheecckklliisstt  box is similar to a mmeennuu box; there are multiple entries presented in the form of a menu.  Another difference is that you
              can indicate which entry is currently selected, by setting its _s_t_a_t_u_s to _o_n.  Instead of choosing one entry among the entries, each en-
              try can be turned on or off by the user.  The initial on/off state of each entry is specified by _s_t_a_t_u_s.

              On exit, a list of the _t_a_g strings of those entries that are turned on will be printed on ddiiaalloogg's output.

              If  the  "----sseeppaarraattee--oouuttppuutt"  option is not given, the strings will be quoted as needed to make it simple for scripts to separate them.
              By default, this uses double-quotes.  See the "----ssiinnggllee--qquuootteedd" option, which modifies the quoting behavior.

              The directory-selection dialog displays a text-entry window in which you can type a directory, and above that a windows with  directory
              names.

              Here ffiilleeppaatthh can be a filepath in which case the directory window will display the contents of the path and the text-entry window will
              contain the preselected directory.

              Use tab or arrow keys to move between the windows.  Within the directory window, use the up/down arrow keys to scroll the  current  se-
              lection.  Use the space-bar to copy the current selection into the text-entry window.

              Typing  any  printable  characters  switches focus to the text-entry window, entering that character as well as scrolling the directory
              window to the closest match.

              Use a carriage return or the "OK" button to accept the current value in the text-entry window and exit.

              On exit, the contents of the text-entry window are written to ddiiaalloogg's output.

              The edit-box dialog displays a copy of the file.  You may edit it using the _b_a_c_k_s_p_a_c_e, _d_e_l_e_t_e and cursor keys to correct typing errors.
              It also recognizes pageup/pagedown.  Unlike the ----iinnppuuttbbooxx, you must tab to the "OK" or "Cancel" buttons to close the dialog.  Pressing
              the "Enter" key within the box will split the corresponding line.

              On exit, the contents of the edit window are written to ddiiaalloogg's output.

              The ffoorrmm dialog displays a form consisting of labels and fields, which are positioned on a scrollable window by  coordinates  given  in
              the script.  The field length _f_l_e_n and input-length _i_l_e_n tell how long the field can be.  The former defines the length shown for a se-
              lected field, while the latter defines the permissible length of the data entered in the field.

              +o   If _f_l_e_n is zero, the corresponding field cannot be altered.  and the contents of the field determine the displayed-length.

              +o   If _f_l_e_n is negative, the corresponding field cannot be altered, and the negated value of _f_l_e_n is used as the displayed-length.

              +o   If _i_l_e_n is zero, it is set to _f_l_e_n.

              Use up/down arrows (or control/N, control/P) to move between fields.  Use tab to move between windows.

              On exit, the contents of the form-fields are written to ddiiaalloogg's output, each field separated by a newline.  The text used to fill non-
              editable fields (_f_l_e_n is zero or negative) is not written out.

              The  ffsseelleecctt  (file-selection)  dialog displays a text-entry window in which you can type a filename (or directory), and above that two
              windows with directory names and filenames.

              Here ffiilleeppaatthh can be a filepath in which case the file and directory windows will display the contents of the path and  the  text-entry
              window will contain the preselected filename.

              Use  tab or arrow keys to move between the windows.  Within the directory or filename windows, use the up/down arrow keys to scroll the
              current selection.  Use the space-bar to copy the current selection into the text-entry window.

              Typing any printable characters switches focus to the text-entry window, entering that character as well as scrolling the directory and
              filename windows to the closest match.

              Typing the space character forces ddiiaalloogg to complete the current name (up to the point where there may be a match against more than one
              entry).

              Use a carriage return or the "OK" button to accept the current value in the text-entry window and exit.

              On exit, the contents of the text-entry window are written to ddiiaalloogg's output.

              A ggaauuggee box displays a meter along the bottom of the box.  The meter indicates the percentage.  New percentages are read from  standard
              input,  one integer per line.  The meter is updated to reflect each new percentage.  If the standard input reads the string "XXX", then
              the first line following is taken as an integer percentage, then subsequent lines up to another "XXX" are used for a new  prompt.   The
              gauge exits when EOF is reached on the standard input.

              The _p_e_r_c_e_n_t value denotes the initial percentage shown in the meter.  If not specified, it is zero.

              On exit, no text is written to ddiiaalloogg's output.  The widget accepts no input, so the exit status is always OK.

              An  iinnffoo box is basically a mmeessssaaggee box.  However, in this case, ddiiaalloogg will exit immediately after displaying the message to the user.
              The screen is not cleared when ddiiaalloogg exits, so that the message will remain on the screen until the calling  shell  script  clears  it
              later.  This is useful when you want to inform the user that some operations are carrying on that may require some time to finish.

              On exit, no text is written to ddiiaalloogg's output.  An OK exit status is returned.

              An iinnppuutt box is useful when you want to ask questions that require the user to input a string as the answer.  If init is supplied it is
              used to initialize the input string.  When entering the string, the _b_a_c_k_s_p_a_c_e, _d_e_l_e_t_e and cursor keys can be used to correct typing er-
              rors.  If the input string is longer than can fit in the dialog box, the input field will be scrolled.

              On exit, the input string will be printed on ddiiaalloogg's output.

              An iinnppuuttmmeennuu box is very similar to an ordinary mmeennuu box.  There are only a few differences between them:

              1.  The entries are not automatically centered but left adjusted.

              2.  An extra button (called _R_e_n_a_m_e) is implied to rename the current item when it is pressed.

              3.  It is possible to rename the current entry by pressing the _R_e_n_a_m_e button.  Then ddiiaalloogg will write the following on ddiiaalloogg's output.

              As  its  name  suggests, a mmeennuu box is a dialog box that can be used to present a list of choices in the form of a menu for the user to
              choose.  Choices are displayed in the order given.  Each menu entry consists of a _t_a_g string and an _i_t_e_m string.  The _t_a_g gives the en-
              try  a  name to distinguish it from the other entries in the menu.  The _i_t_e_m is a short description of the option that the entry repre-
              sents.  The user can move between the menu entries by pressing the cursor keys, the first letter of the _t_a_g as a hot-key, or the number
              keys _1 through _9.  There are _m_e_n_u_-_h_e_i_g_h_t entries displayed in the menu at one time, but the menu will be scrolled if there are more en-
              tries than that.

              On exit the _t_a_g of the chosen menu entry will be printed on ddiiaalloogg's output.  If the "----hheellpp--bbuuttttoonn" option is given, the corresponding
              help text will be printed if the user selects the help button.

              The  mmiixxeeddffoorrmm  dialog displays a form consisting of labels and fields, much like the ----ffoorrmm dialog.  It differs by adding a field-type
              parameter to each field's description.  Each bit in the type denotes an attribute of the field:

              1    hidden, e.g., a password field.

              2    readonly, e.g., a label.

              A mmiixxeeddggaauuggee box displays a meter along the bottom of the box.  The meter indicates the percentage.

              It also displays a list of the _t_a_g- and _i_t_e_m-values at the top of the box.  See dialog(3) for the tag values.

              The _t_e_x_t is shown as a caption between the list and meter.  The _p_e_r_c_e_n_t value denotes the initial percentage shown in the meter.

              No provision is made for reading data from the standard input as ----ggaauuggee does.

              On exit, no text is written to ddiiaalloogg's output.  The widget accepts no input, so the exit status is always OK.

              A mmeessssaaggee box is very similar to a yyeess//nnoo box.  The only difference between a mmeessssaaggee box and a yyeess//nnoo box is that a  mmeessssaaggee  box  has
              only  a  single OOKK button.  You can use this dialog box to display any message you like.  After reading the message, the user can press
              the _E_N_T_E_R key so that ddiiaalloogg will exit and the calling shell script can continue its operation.

              If the message is too large for the space, ddiiaalloogg may allow you to scroll it, provided that the underlying curses implementation is ca-
              pable enough.  In this case, a percentage is shown in the base of the widget.

              On exit, no text is written to ddiiaalloogg's output.  Only an "OK" button is provided for input, but an ESC exit status may be returned.

              A ppaauussee box displays a meter along the bottom of the box.  The meter indicates how many seconds remain until the end of the pause.  The
              pause exits when timeout is reached or the user presses the OK button (status OK) or the user presses the CANCEL button or Esc key.

              A ppaasssswwoorrdd box is similar to an input box, except that the text the user enters is not displayed.  This is useful  when  prompting  for
              passwords  or  other  sensitive information.  Be aware that if anything is passed in "init", it will be visible in the system's process
              table to casual snoopers.  Also, it is very confusing to the user to provide them with a default password they cannot see.   For  these
              reasons, using "init" is highly discouraged.  See "----iinnsseeccuurree" if you do not care about your password.

              On exit, the input string will be printed on ddiiaalloogg's output.

              This is identical to ----ffoorrmm except that all text fields are treated as ppaasssswwoorrdd widgets rather than iinnppuuttbbooxx widgets.

              A pprrggbbooxx is very similar to a pprrooggrraammbbooxx.

              This dialog box is used to display the output of a command that is specified as an argument to pprrggbbooxx.

              After  the  command  completes, the user can press the _E_N_T_E_R key so that ddiiaalloogg will exit and the calling shell script can continue its
              operation.

              If three parameters are given, it displays the text under the title, delineated from the scrolling file's contents.  If only two param-
              eters are given, this text is omitted.

              A pprrooggrraammbbooxx is very similar to a pprrooggrreessssbbooxx.  The only difference between a pprrooggrraamm box and a pprrooggrreessss box is that a pprrooggrraamm box dis-
              plays an OOKK button (but only after the command completes).

              This dialog box is used to display the piped output of a command.  After the command completes, the user can press  the  _E_N_T_E_R  key  so
              that ddiiaalloogg will exit and the calling shell script can continue its operation.

              If three parameters are given, it displays the text under the title, delineated from the scrolling file's contents.  If only two param-

              A pprrooggrreessssbbooxx is similar to an ttaaiillbbooxx, except that

              a) rather than displaying the contents of a file,
                 it displays the piped output of a command and

              b) it will exit when it reaches the end of the file
                 (there is no "OK" button).

              If three parameters are given, it displays the text under the title, delineated from the scrolling file's contents.  If only two param-

              A  rraaddiioolliisstt  box is similar to a mmeennuu box.  The only difference is that you can indicate which entry is currently selected, by setting
              its _s_t_a_t_u_s to _o_n.

              On exit, the tag of the selected item is written to ddiiaalloogg's output.

              Allow the user to select from a range of values, e.g., using a slider.  The dialog shows the current value as a bar (like the gauge di-
              alog).  Tabs or arrow keys move the cursor between the buttons and the value.  When the cursor is on the value, you can edit it by:

              left/right cursor movement to select a digit to modify

              +/-  characters to increment/decrement the digit by one

              0 through 9
                   to set the digit to the given value

              Some keys are also recognized in all cursor positions:

              home/end
                   set the value to its maximum or minimum

              pageup/pagedown
                   increment the value so that the slider moves by one column

              Display text from a file in a dialog box as a background task, as in a "tail -f &" command.  Scroll left/right using vi-style  'h'  and
              'l', or arrow-keys.  A '0' resets the scrolling.

              Dialog  treats the background task specially if there are other widgets (----aanndd--wwiiddggeett) on the screen concurrently.  Until those widgets
              are closed (e.g., an "OK"), ddiiaalloogg will perform all of the tailboxbg widgets in the same process, polling for updates.  You may  use  a
              tab  to  traverse between the widgets on the screen, and close them individually, e.g., by pressing _E_N_T_E_R.  Once the non-tailboxbg wid-
              gets are closed, ddiiaalloogg forks a copy of itself into the background, and prints its process id if the "----nnoo--kkiillll" option is given.

              On exit, no text is written to ddiiaalloogg's output.  Only an "EXIT" button is provided for input, but an ESC exit status may be returned.

              NOTE: Older versions of ddiiaalloogg forked immediately and attempted to update the screen individually.  Besides being bad for  performance,
              it was unworkable.  Some older scripts may not work properly with the polled scheme.

              A  tteexxtt  box  lets  you  display the contents of a text file in a dialog box.  It is like a simple text file viewer.  The user can move
              through the file by using the cursor, page-up, page-down and _H_O_M_E_/_E_N_D keys available on most keyboards.  If the lines are too  long  to
              be  displayed in the box, the _L_E_F_T_/_R_I_G_H_T keys can be used to scroll the text region horizontally.  You may also use vi-style keys h, j,
              k, and l in place of the cursor keys, and B or N in place of the page-up and page-down keys.  Scroll up/down  using  vi-style  'k'  and
              'j',  or  arrow-keys.   Scroll  left/right using vi-style 'h' and 'l', or arrow-keys.  A '0' resets the left/right scrolling.  For more
              convenience, vi-style forward and backward searching functions are also provided.

              On exit, no text is written to ddiiaalloogg's output.  Only an "EXIT" button is provided for input, but an ESC exit status may be returned.

              A dialog is displayed which allows you to select hour, minute and second.  If the values for hour, minute or second are missing or neg-
              ative,  the current date's corresponding values are used.  You can increment or decrement any of those using the left-, up-, right- and
              down-arrows.  Use tab or backtab to move between windows.

              On exit, the result is printed in the form hour:minute:second.  The format can be overridden using the ----ttiimmee--ffoorrmmaatt option.

              Display data organized as a tree.  Each group of data contains a tag, the text to display for the item, its status ("on" or "off")  and
              the depth of the item in the tree.

              Only one item can be selected (like the rraaddiioolliisstt).  The tag is not displayed.

              On exit, the tag of the selected item is written to ddiiaalloogg's output.

              A  yyeess//nnoo dialog box of size _h_e_i_g_h_t rows by _w_i_d_t_h columns will be displayed.  The string specified by _t_e_x_t is displayed inside the dia-
              log box.  If this string is too long to fit in one line, it will be automatically divided into multiple lines  at  appropriate  places.
              The  _t_e_x_t  string can also contain the sub-string "_\_n" or newline characters `_\_n' to control line breaking explicitly.  This dialog box
              is useful for asking questions that require the user to answer either yes or no.  The dialog box has a YYeess button and a NNoo  button,  in
              which the user can switch between by pressing the _T_A_B key.

              On  exit, no text is written to ddiiaalloogg's output.  In addition to the "Yes" and "No" exit codes (see DIAGNOSTICS) an ESC exit status may
              be returned.

              The codes used for "Yes" and "No" match those used for "OK" and "Cancel", internally no distinction is made.

       These options can be used to transform whitespace (space, tab, newline) as dialog reads the script:
              ----ccrr--wwrraapp, ----nnoo--ccoollllaappssee, ----nnoo--nnll--eexxppaanndd, and ----ttrriimm

       The options are not independent:

       +o   DDiiaalloogg  checks  if  the  script contains at least one "\n" and (unless ----nnoo--nnll--eexxppaanndd is set) will ignore the ----nnoo--ccoollllaappssee and ----ttrriimm op-
           tions.

       +o   After checking for "\n" and the ----nnoo--nnll--eexxppaanndd option, ddiiaalloogg handles the ----ttrriimm option.

           If the ----ttrriimm option takes effect, then ddiiaalloogg ignores ----nnoo--ccoollllaappssee.  It changes sequences of tabs, spaces (and newlines unless  --ccrr--wwrraapp
           is set) to a single space.

       +o   If  neither the "\n" or ----ttrriimm cases apply, ddiiaalloogg checks ----nnoo--ccoollllaappssee to decide whether to reduce sequences of tabs and spaces to a sin-
           gle space.

           In this case, ddiiaalloogg ignores --ccrr--wwrraapp and does not modify newlines.

       Taking those dependencies into account, here is a table summarizing the behavior for the various combinations of options.  The  table  assumes
       that the script contains at least one "\n" when the ----nnoo--nnll--eexxppaanndd option is not set.

       1.  Create a sample configuration file by typing:

              dialog --create-rc _f_i_l_e

       2.  At start, ddiiaalloogg determines the settings to use as follows:

           a)  if environment variable DDIIAALLOOGGRRCC is set, its value determines the name of the configuration file.

           b)  if the file in (a) is not found, use the file _$_H_O_M_E_/_._d_i_a_l_o_g_r_c as the configuration file.

           c)  if the file in (b) is not found, try using the GLOBALRC file determined at compile-time, i.e., _/_e_t_c_/_d_i_a_l_o_g_r_c.

           d)  if the file in (c) is not found, use compiled in defaults.

       3.  Edit the sample configuration file and copy it to some place that ddiiaalloogg can find, as stated in step 2 above.

KKEEYY BBIINNDDIINNGGSS
       You  can  override or add to key bindings in ddiiaalloogg by adding to the configuration file.  DDiiaalloogg's bbiinnddkkeeyy command maps single keys to its in-
       ternal coding.

              bindkey _w_i_d_g_e_t _c_u_r_s_e_s___k_e_y _d_i_a_l_o_g___k_e_y

       The _w_i_d_g_e_t name can be "*" (all widgets), or specific widgets such as tteexxttbbooxx.  Specific widget bindings override the "*" bindings.   User-de-
       fined bindings override the built-in bindings.

       The  _c_u_r_s_e_s___k_e_y  can  be any of the names derived from ccuurrsseess..hh, e.g., "HELP" from "KEY_HELP".  DDiiaalloogg also recognizes ANSI control characters
       such as "^A", "^?", as well as C1-controls such as "~A" and "~?".  Finally, it allows any single character to be escaped with a backslash.

       DDiiaalloogg's internal keycode names correspond to the DDLLGG__KKEEYYSS__EENNUUMM type in ddllgg__kkeeyyss..hh, e.g., "HELP" from "DLGK_HELP".

   WWiiddggeett NNaammeess
       Some widgets (such as the formbox) have an area where fields can be edited.  Those are managed in a subwindow of the widget, and may have sep-
       arate keybindings from the main widget because the subwindows are registered using a different name.

                                                         _W_i_d_g_e_t        _W_i_n_d_o_w _n_a_m_e   _S_u_b_w_i_n_d_o_w _N_a_m_e

       Some widgets are actually other widgets, using internal settings to modify the behavior.  Those use the same widget name as the actual widget:

   BBuuiilltt--iinn BBiinnddiinnggss
       This  manual page does not list the key bindings for each widget, because that detailed information can be obtained by running ddiiaalloogg.  If you
       have set the ----ttrraaccee option, ddiiaalloogg writes the key-binding information for each widget as it is registered.

   EExxaammppllee
       Normally ddiiaalloogg uses different keys for navigating between the buttons and editing part of a dialog versus navigating within the editing part.
       That  is,  tab  (and back-tab) traverse buttons (or between buttons and the editing part), while arrow keys traverse fields within the editing
       part.  Tabs are also recognized as a special case for traversing between widgets, e.g., when using multiple tailboxbg widgets.

       Some users may wish to use the same key for traversing within the editing part as for traversing between buttons.  The form widget is  written
       to  support this sort of redefinition of the keys, by adding a special group in ddllggkk__kkeeyyss..hh for "form" (left/right/next/prev).  Here is an ex-
       ample binding demonstrating how to do this:

              bindkey formfield TAB  form_NEXT
              bindkey formbox   TAB  form_NEXT
              bindkey formfield BTAB form_prev
              bindkey formbox   BTAB form_prev

       That type of redefinition would not be useful in other widgets, e.g., calendar, due to the potentially large number of fields to traverse.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       DDIIAALLOOGGOOPPTTSS     Define this variable to apply any of the common options to each widget.  Most of the common options are reset before processing
                      each  widget.   If you set the options in this environment variable, they are applied to ddiiaalloogg's state after the reset.  As in
                      the "----ffiillee" option, double-quotes and backslashes are interpreted.

                      The "----ffiillee" option is not considered a common option (so you cannot embed it within this environment variable).

       DDIIAALLOOGGRRCC       Define this variable if you want to specify the name of the configuration file to use.

       DDIIAALLOOGG__OOKK      Define any of these variables to change the exit code on Cancel (1), error (-1), ESC (255), Extra  (3),  Help  (2),  Help  with
                      ----iitteemm--hheellpp (2), or OK (0).  Normally shell scripts cannot distinguish between -1 and 255.

       DDIIAALLOOGG__TTTTYY     Set  this variable to "1" to provide compatibility with older versions of ddiiaalloogg which assumed that if the script redirects the
                      standard output, that the "----ssttddoouutt" option was given.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       The ddiiaalloogg sources contain several samples of how to use the different box options and how they look.  Just take a  look  into  the  directory
       ssaammpplleess// of the source.

DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS
       Exit  status  is  subject  to  being overridden by environment variables.  The default values and corresponding environment variables that can
       override them are:

       0    if the YYEESS or OOKK button is pressed (DIALOG_OK).

       1    if the NNoo or CCaanncceell button is pressed (DIALOG_CANCEL).

       2    if the HHeellpp button is pressed (DIALOG_HELP),
            except as noted below about DIALOG_ITEM_HELP.

       3    if the EExxttrraa button is pressed (DIALOG_EXTRA).

       4    if the HHeellpp button is pressed,
            and the ----iitteemm--hheellpp option is set
            and the DIALOG_ITEM_HELP environment variable is set to 4.

            While any of the exit-codes can be overridden using environment variables, this special case was introduced in 2004 to simplify  compati-
            bility.   DDiiaalloogg  uses DIALOG_ITEM_HELP(4) internally, but unless the environment variable is also set, it changes that to DIALOG_HELP(2)
            on exit.

       -1   if errors occur inside ddiiaalloogg (DIALOG_ERROR) or ddiiaalloogg exits because the _E_S_C key (DIALOG_ESC) was pressed.

PPOORRTTAABBIILLIITTYY
       DDiiaalloogg works with X/Open curses.  However, some implementations have deficiencies:

          +o   HPUX curses (and perhaps others) do not open the terminal properly for the _n_e_w_t_e_r_m function.  This interferes with ddiiaalloogg's  ----iinnppuutt--ffdd
              option, by preventing cursor-keys and similar escape sequences from being recognized.

          +o   NetBSD 5.1 curses has incomplete support for wide-characters.  ddiiaalloogg will build, but not all examples display properly.

CCOOMMPPAATTIIBBIILLIITTYY
       You may want to write scripts which run with other ddiiaalloogg "clones".

   OOrriiggiinnaall DDiiaalloogg
       First,  there is the "original" ddiiaalloogg program to consider (versions 0.3 to 0.9).  It had some misspelled (or inconsistent) options.  The ddiiaa--
       lloogg program maps those deprecated options to the preferred ones.  They include:

              _O_p_t_i_o_n         _T_r_e_a_t_m_e_n_t

   XXddiiaalloogg
       This is an X application, rather than a terminal program.  With some care, it is possible to write useful scripts that work with both  XXddiiaalloogg
       and ddiiaalloogg.

       The ddiiaalloogg program ignores these options which are recognized by XXddiiaalloogg:

       XXddiiaalloogg's  manpage has a section discussing its compatibility with ddiiaalloogg.  There are some differences not shown in the manpage.  For example,
       the html documentation states

              Note: former Xdialog releases used the "\n" (line feed) as a results separator for the checklist widget; this has been changed  to  "/"
              in Xdialog v1.5.0 to make it compatible with (c)dialog.  In your old scripts using the Xdialog checklist, you will then have to add the
              ----sseeppaarraattee--oouuttppuutt option before the ----cchheecckklliisstt one.

       DDiiaalloogg has not used a different separator; the difference was likely due to confusion regarding some script.

   WWhhiippttaaiill
       Then there is wwhhiippttaaiill.  For practical purposes, it is maintained by Debian (very little work is done by its upstream developers).  Its  docu-
       mentation (README.whiptail) claims

              whiptail(1) is a lightweight replacement for dialog(1),
              to provide dialog boxes for shell scripts.
              It is built on the
              newt windowing library rather than the ncurses library, allowing
              it to be smaller in embedded environments such as installers,
              rescue disks, etc.

              whiptail is designed to be drop-in compatible with dialog, but
              has less features: some dialog boxes are not implemented, such
              as tailbox, timebox, calendarbox, etc.

       Comparing actual sizes (Debian testing, 2007/1/10): The total of sizes for wwhhiippttaaiill, the newt, popt and slang libraries is 757 KB.  The compa-
       rable number for ddiiaalloogg (counting ncurses) is 520 KB.  Disregard the first paragraph.

       The second paragraph is misleading, since wwhhiippttaaiill also does not work for common options of ddiiaalloogg, such as the gauge box.  wwhhiippttaaiill  is  less
       compatible with ddiiaalloogg than the original mid-1990s dialog 0.4 program.

       wwhhiippttaaiill's  manpage  borrows features from ddiiaalloogg, e.g., but oddly cites only ddiiaalloogg versions up to 0.4 (1994) as a source.  That is, its man-
       page refers to features which were borrowed from more recent versions of ddiiaalloogg, e.g.,

       Somewhat humorously, one may note that the ppoopptt feature (undocumented in its manpage) of using a "--" as an escape was documented in  ddiiaalloogg's
       manpage  about a year before it was mentioned in wwhhiippttaaiill's manpage.  wwhhiippttaaiill's manpage incorrectly attributes that to ggeettoopptt (and is inaccu-
       rate anyway).

       Debian uses wwhhiippttaaiill for the official ddiiaalloogg variation.

       The ddiiaalloogg program ignores or maps these options which are recognized by wwhhiippttaaiill:

       There are visual differences which are not addressed by command-line options:

       +o   ddiiaalloogg centers lists within the window.  wwhhiippttaaiill typically puts lists against the left margin.

       +o   wwhhiippttaaiill uses angle brackets ("<" and ">") for marking buttons.  ddiiaalloogg uses square brackets.

       +o   wwhhiippttaaiill marks the limits of subtitles with vertical bars.  ddiiaalloogg does not mark the limits.

       +o   wwhhiippttaaiill attempts to mark the top/bottom cells of a scrollbar with up/down arrows.  When it cannot do this, it fills those cells with  the
           background color of the scrollbar and confusing the user.  ddiiaalloogg uses the entire scrollbar space, thereby getting better resolution.

       Perhaps.

       Yura Kalinichenko adapted the gauge widget as "pause".

       This is a rewrite (except as needed to provide compatibility) of the earlier version of ddiiaalloogg 00..99aa, which lists as authors:

       +o   Savio Lam - version 0.3, "dialog"
